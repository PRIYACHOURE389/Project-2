# PROJECT -2

## Task 1 - User Overview Analysis

Sub-tasks:

### Identify Top Handsets and Manufacturers:

* Use grouping and aggregation functions to find the top handsets and manufacturers based on usage frequency.

### Aggregate User Behavior on Applications:

* Calculate various metrics like session duration, data volume, etc., per user per application.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Describe variables and their data types.
* Analyze basic metrics.
* Conduct non-graphical and graphical univariate analysis.
* Explore bivariate relationships.
* Perform variable transformations and correlation analysis.
* Apply dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.

## Task 2 - User Engagement Analysis

Sub-tasks:

* Aggregate Engagement Metrics:
* Calculate engagement metrics per user (e.g., session frequency, duration, traffic).
* K-means Clustering for Engagement Groups:
* Normalize engagement metrics.
* Apply k-means clustering to classify users into engagement groups.
* Interpret cluster metrics.
* 
### Top Engaged Users per Application:

* Aggregate total traffic per application and find top engaged users.
* Visualize top used applications.

## Task 3 - Experience Analytics

Sub-tasks:

* Aggregate Network Parameters and Handset Type:
* Compute average TCP retransmission, RTT, throughput, and identify handset type per customer.

### Analysis of Network Parameters:

* List top, bottom, and most frequent values of TCP, RTT, and throughput.
* Investigate distribution and average values per handset type.
* K-means Clustering for User Experience:
* Perform k-means clustering based on experience metrics.
* Provide a brief description of each cluster.
  
## Task 4 - Satisfaction Analysis

Sub-tasks:

Calculate Engagement and Experience Scores:
Compute engagement score based on clustering.
Calculate experience score using clustering results.

### Satisfaction Score Calculation:

Average engagement and experience scores to derive satisfaction score.
Identify top satisfied customers.

### Regression Model for Satisfaction Prediction:

Build a regression model to predict satisfaction score.

### K-means Clustering for Satisfaction Analysis:

Perform k-means clustering on engagement and experience scores.
Aggregate average scores per cluster.

## Model Deployment and Tracking:

Deploy the satisfaction prediction model.
Monitor model performance and changes using MLOps tools.

## General Guidelines:

* Use Python for scripting and data analysis (libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
* Ensure thorough data preprocessing, handling missing values and outliers appropriately.
* Utilize visualization techniques for clear presentation of insights.
* Document your code clearly and include comments where necessary.
* Create a README file explaining the project structure, dependencies, and instructions for running the code.
* Keep track of your progress with frequent commits on GitHub.
* Ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices.
* Test your code thoroughly, including unit tests for critical functions.
* Use CI/CD tools like Travis CI or GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
* Dockerize your application for easy deployment and scalability.
* Pay attention to presentation quality and professionalism in both code and reporting.
* Collaborate with peers for insights and support, but ensure individual submissions.
